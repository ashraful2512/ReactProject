      <p>
        I am deeply committed to giving back to my community through various
        volunteer initiatives. I regularly engage with local organizations that
        focus on empowering underserved populations. My contributions include
        coordinating educational workshops for youth, where I share my knowledge
        in technology and data science, helping them build critical skills for
        the future. Additionally, I participate in environmental clean-up drives
        and food distribution events, striving to make a positive impact on both
        people and the planet. Through these experiences, I’ve learned the
        importance of collaboration and compassion, and I’m inspired to continue
        finding ways to uplift those around me.
